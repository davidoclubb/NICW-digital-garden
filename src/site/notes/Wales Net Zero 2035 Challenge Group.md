The ‘Group’, led by former Environment Minister Jane Davidson, is tasked with: 

- finding the best examples of transformative change from Wales and around the world and bringing them to Wales; 
- challenging the Welsh government and Senedd (Welsh Parliament) to go further and faster; 
- imagining what a fairer, more sustainable future looks like for the Welsh nation.
