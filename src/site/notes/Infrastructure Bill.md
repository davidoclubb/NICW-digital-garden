The key purposes of the Bill are:

- to establish a unified infrastructure consenting process for specified types of major infrastructure both on and offshore (up to territorial seaward boundary), including energy, transport, waste, water and gas projects. The new form of consent will be known as an “infrastructure consent” (“IC”) and will be issued in relation to projects which are prescribed as a “Significant Infrastructure Project” (“SIP”);
- to provide that developers must obtain an IC for a SIP. The IC is intended to contain the full range of authorisations required to enable the development to be implemented; and
- to therefore replace, either fully or partially, a number of existing statutory regimes for the consenting of infrastructure projects and rationalise the number of authorisations required to construct and operate such development into a single consent
