### About the NICW digital garden

1. This is a proof of concept pilot to test the ability to publish information more regularly and in more detail, to improve transparency about how [[NICW\|NICW]] operates
2. The site may not be updated or become unavailable. It may be removed without notice.
3. The content is available only in English during the pilot phase.
4. The site works best on larger screens

### How to use

1. Feel free to 'browse' the garden using the links on the left hand side, or the local graph on the right hand side
2. If you're interested in who we're meeting (and when), you might want to start by clicking on the 'meetings' button in the top left hand side of the menu
