"It's quite simple - we want to make noise, as much Welsh noise as possible.

Wales Week London is the annual showcase of activities and events that celebrate and promote everything that is great about Wales.

This is the opportunity for Welsh organisations to promote their products and services, and develop new London-based audiences, partnerships and connections."
