"Ofgem is Great Britain’s independent energy regulator.

We work to protect energy consumers, especially vulnerable people, by ensuring they are treated fairly and benefit from a cleaner, greener environment.

We are responsible for:

-   working with government, industry and consumer groups to deliver a net-zero economy, at the lowest cost to consumers
-   stamping out sharp and bad practice, ensuring fair treatment for all consumers, especially the vulnerable
-   enabling competition and innovation, which drives down prices and results in new products and services for consumers."
