"As an expert body, the Design Commission for Wales was established by the National Assembly for Wales to promote good design. We work with local planning authorities, investors, developers and commissioning clients to capture the value of high quality design; helping you to deliver better outcomes, a better return on investment and greater public good. We also nurture the design talent and skills necessary for growth and innovation."
