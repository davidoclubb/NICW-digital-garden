"We are a busy shipping gateway handling liquid, bulk, break bulk and heavy lift cargoes from our western UK site. A twice daily freight and passenger ferry connects the UK and Ireland. And our development strategy is creating new opportunities in the marine renewables and hospitality sectors.

Our drive is to be the port of choice for industry and to create lasting opportunities for our communities."
